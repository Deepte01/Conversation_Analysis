00:00:30 John (CarSales.com): Of course, Mr. Smith. We can offer you a bulk discount for purchasing 10,000 cars. Our cars come with advanced safety features, fuel-efficient engines, and the latest technology for a comfortable driving experience.

00:00:35 Mr. Smith (Prospective customer): That sounds good. What would be the total cost for 10,000 cars, including the bulk discount?

00:00:40 John (CarSales.com): We can offer you a special price of $20,000 per car for a total of $200 million for 10,000 cars. This price includes the bulk discount and delivery to your location.

00:00:45 Mr. Smith (Prospective customer): The price seems reasonable. Can we negotiate on the price further?

00:00:50 John (CarSales.com): We understand the importance of a good deal for such a large purchase. How about we reduce the price to $18,000 per car, bringing the total to $180 million for 10,000 cars?

00:00:55 Mr. Smith (Prospective customer): That sounds more appealing. I think we have a deal at $18,000 per car. When can we expect the delivery of the cars?
